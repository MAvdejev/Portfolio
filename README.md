Hello!

In this repository, you will find examples of projects I worked on during my master's program in Digital Driven Business. 

These projects highlight my expertise in data analysis, Python programming, and SQL, covering areas such as business statistics, database management, machine learning (supervised and unsupervised), and online data mining through web scraping. 

They demonstrate my experience with data cleaning, manipulation, transformation, validation, and normalization, as well as ETL processes, statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, feature engineering, predictive modeling, clustering, and regression analysis. Through these projects, I have developed skills in extracting insights from raw data, ensuring data quality, and building data-driven solutions.
